# provider_state_management

build a favorite movie list feature and manage the app state using Provider. Our app has 2 screens: HomeScreen and MyListScreen:


## Getting Started

HomeScreen: Displays a list of movies within a list view. Next to each movie, there will be a heart-shaped button icon to add or remove the corresponding movie to the favorites list. Besides the list view, we also have a red button that displays the number of movies in the favorites list. The user can use this button to navigate to MyListScreen.
MyListScreen: Show only movies that the user loves and wants to watch later. The user can remove a movie from this list using the Remove button corresponding to that movie.
